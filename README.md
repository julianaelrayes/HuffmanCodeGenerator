# HuffmanCodeGenerator

Finds the shortest path between two vertices by implementing an undirected weighted Graph ADT and performing **Dijkstra's Algorithm**.

## Design 

* [x] Generates a list of the frequency in which characters appear in the string using a map.
* [x] Inserts the characters and their frequencies into a priority queue (sorted first by the lowest frequency and then lexicographically).
* [x] Removes two characters/frequencies pairs from the priority queue and turns them into leaf nodes on a binary tree.
* [x] An intermediate node was created to be their parent using the sum of the frequencies for those children. It is inserted back in the priority queue.
* [x] The last pair in the priority queue is the root node of the tree.
* [x] Using this new tree,the characters in the string are encoded using a map with their prefix code by traversing the tree to find where the characterâ€™s leaf is. When traversal goes left, it adds a 0 to the code, when it goes right, it adds a 1 to the code.
* [x] The characters in the string are replaced with their new variable-length prefix codes.
